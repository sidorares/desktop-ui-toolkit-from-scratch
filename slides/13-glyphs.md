title: Text, via XRender
notes: |
  The prettiest mechanism in the toolkit. Land it in three beats:
  upload once, reference by id, and then — the trick — a glyph doesn't have
  to be a letter. Keep it tight, 2 min.

# Text is uploaded once, then referenced

XRender has **glyph sets**: upload a glyph's bitmap, get an id back.

^^^

- `fontkit` shapes a string into positioned glyph ids
- New glyphs are uploaded to the set; the rest are already there
- `RenderCompositeGlyphs` draws a run by **id**, not by pixels

^^^

A paragraph of text you have shown before costs one request with a list of
integers in it.

^^^

And a glyph does not have to be a letter. A solid 1×1 glyph, composited in
a run, is a **box** — which is how a terminal draws thousands of cell
backgrounds in one request.
