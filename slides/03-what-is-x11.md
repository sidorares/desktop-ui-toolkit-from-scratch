title: What X11 actually is

  The single most important idea in the talk. Take your time.
  X11 is a *protocol*, not a library. The client sends drawing commands;
  the server owns the pixels. That's why a UI toolkit can be pure JS.

- `CreateWindow`, `MapWindow`, `PolyFillRectangle`, `RenderCompositeGlyphs`
- The **server** owns the pixels; the client owns the *description*
- Latency is a first-class design constraint — it always was

That includes Node.
